# Express Note Taker

## express-note-taker

## Description

Using ExpressJS this application allows you to enter, save, and delete notes for anything you may need. Notes require a title and description and are saved to the left pane of the UI. The Trash Icon allows you to delete any saved notes if they're no longer needed. We're using ExpressJS to handle the API calls necessary to perform the various GET, POST, and DELETE operations to support the note functionality.

## Installation

You'll need to install ExpressJS. Simply npm install express. For Development we're also requiring an npm package called "uuid" in order to procedurally generate ID's for each of the notes that are being entered. Ensure this is installed if you're looking to develop against this application, our various endpoints for getting and deleting require the ID to function.

## Usage

Simply click the link to the deployed application (deployed to Heroku). Click "Get Started" to load a list of the notes already saved, add new notes, and delete any existing. These are saved to a JSON database file for reference.
